0.  Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest word in the English language. It means a lung disease caused by inhalation of very fine sand.
1.  getrusage returns the resource usage measures for a process.
2.  16
3.  We pass after and before by reference because the second argument for getrusage must be an address.
4.  The loop reads one character of the 'text' at a time. If it is an apostrophe or an alphabet, add it to the 'word' array and increment index. 
    If the string that we are reading is however too long to read, we eat away that string. 
    If the string has a digit in it, we ignore that string too. Finally, if none of these is true, it must mean that we have found our string. 
    We terminate the word array with the ascii NULL and check if the word is misspelt. Also, it is here we check our benchmarks.
5.  fgetc() was used to read words because if we instead used fscanf(), then it would have been difficult to check if our word had a number or if the word was more than the length. 
6.  Because we don't want that by mistake, we modify the data the 'char*'s point to.
7.  I used a 'trie' to implement the spell checker. Inside every node, is
    an array of 28 pointers to 'tries', 27 for a-z and ' and the last one for marking the end of word. IF the last one points to somethin, the word is formed.
8.  I think my code was quite fast.
9.  Earlier I was going to use a hash table with nodes, but then I changed it to trie.
10. Yes, I do. First of all, my data structure takes up a lot of memory. Secondly, valgrind shows a lot of uninitialized variables, which are actually the empty nodes of the trie structre(of course not every permutation of characters will form a word).
