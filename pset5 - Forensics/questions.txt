2.  In lossy compression, some data is lost, although it is not noticeable to the eye. In lossless compression, there is no such          
    loss of data.
3.  JPEG, GIF.
4.  When a file is deleted on a FAT file system, the system modifies the filename's first character to indicate that it has been  
    deleted. Then the system moves the clusters of the file to the hard drive's list of free clusters.
5.  Someone like me can overwrite the deleted file's cluster with ASCII NULL characters or pseudorandom numbers. Also, the hard disk   
    can be physically destroyed.
6.  This header file defines a set of integer types that can be used to store data of particular size. For example, the uint8_t   
    stores 1 byte of data.
7.  These types allow storing data of fixed width.
8.  1 BYTE = 1 byte, 1 DWORD = 4 bytes, 1 LONG = 4 bytes, 1 WORD = 2 bytes.
9.  'b''m'(ascii), 19778(decimal).
10. 'bfSize' is the size of full image while 'biSize' is the size of BITMAPINFOHEADER(40 bytes).
11. If biHeight is negative, it means that the image is stored upside up, since BMP files are otherwise usually stored upside down.
12. biBitCount
13. fopen might return NULL if the user does not have enough permissions to read the file or the file does not exist for reading.
14. The third argument is always 1 in fread() because we are always reading 1 'n' byte(s).
15. 1
16. fseek is used to move the stream position indicator by a specific amount of bytes.
17. While using fseek, to move the indicator 'x' bytes, we need to tell fseek the position at which we want to move 'x' bytes. If the position is SEEK_CUR, it means to move 'x' bytes from current position.
